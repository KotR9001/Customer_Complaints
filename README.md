# Customer_Complaints
This is a project to demonstrate proficiency in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

-Used Spark to create a dataframe from a Customer Complaints dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/consume-complaints-dataset-fo-nlp). 
-Used Tokenizer, StopWordsRemover, NGram, HashingTF, IDF, & StringIndexer functions in a data prep pipeline to generate label & feature columns. 
-Performed machine learning with a Na√Øve Bayes model to generate label predictions. 
-Tested the accuracy of the model, and after obtaining a satisfactory R^2 score, wrote the output data with actual & predicted product labels to a CSV file. 
-Created a chart in Tableau to show the overlap between actual & predicted product labels.
